Setup

Create Two separate Docker Containers:

Official MySQL Image
https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

Official Ubuntu Image
https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu

Use the following guide for Flask Setup on the Ubuntu Image
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-flask-on-ubuntu-20-04/

Once both containers are configured, the files contained in the GitHub repo can be used to create a MySQL database and create a copy of the website.

Modify the db.py file with your own database information.
